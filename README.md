# POLYGON1

To complete the project, you'll go through several steps:

1. **Generate a 5-item collection using DALLE 2 or Midjourney**: Use the image generation tool to create unique images for your NFTs.

2. **Store items on IPFS using pinata.cloud**: Upload the generated images to IPFS using Pinata for decentralized storage.

3. **Deploy an ERC721 or ERC1155 to the Goerli Ethereum Testnet**: Deploy a smart contract on the Goerli testnet that represents your NFT collection.

4. **Implement a `promptDescription` function**: Include a function in your smart contract that returns the prompt you used to generate the images. This adds transparency and context to your NFT collection.

5. **Map Your NFT Collection using Polygon network token mapper**: This step is optional but recommended for better visualization and interoperability between Ethereum and Polygon networks.

6. **Write a hardhat script to batch mint all NFTs**: Automate the minting process for all NFTs in your collection.

7. **Write a hardhat script to batch transfer all NFTs from Ethereum to Polygon Mumbai using the FxPortal Bridge**: Use the FxPortal Bridge to transfer your NFTs from Ethereum to the Polygon Mumbai testnet.

8. **Write README file**: Document the process and provide clear instructions for others to understand and replicate your project.

Let's dive into each step in more detail:

### 1. Generate NFT Collection Images

Use DALLE 2 or Midjourney to generate unique images for your NFT collection.

### 2. Store Items on IPFS

Upload the generated images to IPFS using Pinata for decentralized storage.

### 3. Deploy ERC721 Contract

Write and deploy an ERC721 smart contract on the Goerli Ethereum Testnet. This contract will represent your NFT collection.

### 4. Implement `promptDescription` Function

Include a function in your smart contract that returns the prompt you used to generate the images. This function adds transparency to your project.

### 5. Map Your NFT Collection using Polygon Network Token Mapper

Optional but recommended for better visualization and interoperability between Ethereum and Polygon networks.

### 6. Write Hardhat Script for Batch Minting

Create a Hardhat script to batch mint all NFTs in your collection. Consider using ERC721A for optimal performance.

### 7. Write Hardhat Script for Batch Transfer to Polygon

Write a Hardhat script to batch transfer all NFTs from Ethereum to Polygon Mumbai using the FxPortal Bridge.
